# Introduction

## How to use this book

This book provides quick answers for all objectives on the RHCSA (EX200) and RHCE (EX300) exams for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Explanations have been left out or the sake of succinctness. As-such, this book will not necessarily teach you everything you need to know to obtain an RHCSA/RHCE certification, or to be an effective system administrator. Its target audience is mainly IT professionals who are already familiar with Red Hat Linux, and anyone who wants a small reference to complement a more comprehensive guide to the RHCSA/RHCE exams.
