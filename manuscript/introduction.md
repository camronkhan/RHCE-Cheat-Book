# Introduction

This book provides the quickest possible solution for every objective on the RHCSA (EX200) and RHCE (EX300) exams for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Long explanations have been completely left out for the sake of succinctness. Consequently, this is not a book for beginners. Its target audience is mainly IT professionals who already have some familiarity with Linux, and anyone who wants a compact reference to complement a more comprehensive guide to the RHCSA/RHCE exams.
