# Introduction

## How to use this book

This book provides answers to all objectives on the RHCSA (EX200) and RHCE (EX300) exams for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. It is not a "brain dump" or an attempt to cheat the exams in any way, nor will it teach you everything you need to know to obtain an RHCSA/RHCE certification. Its target audience is mainly IT professionals who are already familiar with Red Hat Linux, and anyone who wants a small reference guide to complement a more comprehensive book about Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
